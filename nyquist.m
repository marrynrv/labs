% The Nyquist method determines system stability by analyzing the transfer function's 
% Nyquist plot in the complex plane. The open-loop transfer function 
% G(s) = 2 / (sÂ² + 4s + 8) (with K varying from 1 to 5) is analyzed. Stability 
% requires all poles to be in the left half of the complex plane. The system's stability 
% is determined by checking if the Nyquist plot encircles the critical point (-1,0). 
% Increasing K reduces phase and gain margins but does not destabilize the system.

% Defining the transfer function
% Transfer function: G(s) = 2 / (s^2 + 4s + 8)
numerator = 2;           
denominator = [1, 4, 8]; 
G = tf(numerator, denominator);
